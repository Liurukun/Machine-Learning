# Welcome!
<!-- We are setting up a website to promote the use of R - a leading data science programming language - for the data-driven ecological research. -->

<!-- On this website, you can find details on: -->

<!-- - Getting Started -->
<!-- - Modelling Lessons -->

This class walks participants through the steps required to use R for a wide array of data analysis relevant to research in biology and ecology.

The core skills we will cover are as follows:

- best practices in data retriever, management, and visualization
- basic knowledge about data analysis with machine learning methods  
- beneficial practices in modeling complex patterns and processes

The class is extremely participatory, where a lot of training modules are delivered based on the learner's needs.
